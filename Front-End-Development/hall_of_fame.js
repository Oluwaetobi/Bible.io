/**First of all if you think I write comments for fun, you are making a huge mistake, these comments are not
 * just for me but I write comments so that if anyone looks at the code in this game, they can understand
 * things that won't come to mind initially, PLEASE READ THE COMMENTS, they explain some of the methods
 * I'm using, and why I am doing what I am doing, no matter how good you are at coding, you willl always
 * forget why you did something a particular way, every good coder, writes good comments, a wise man once said
 * the faintest pen is better than the sharpest memory, and why is that, because even if you write something
 * faintly as long as you know how to read, it is engraved forever and can always be read, but no matter
 * how good your memory is, you always forget it at some point so START WRITING COMMENTS WHEN YOU CODE!!
